Turbux is designed to speed up your TDD cycle by using a single key
mapping to run the most relevant test based on the current file in vim.
It uses tmux's scriptability to send commands to a chosen pane in your
tmux session, by way of tslime.vim.

For more information, see the documentation.


Dependencies
------------

This plugin depends on tslime.vim, and becomes really awesome when used
with rails.vim. It also makes the assumption that you're using tmux.

**Note:** Due to a bug in the original tslime.vim plugin, please use 
[my fork](https://github.com/jgdavey/tslime.vim).


Installation
------------

Use tpope's pathogen.
